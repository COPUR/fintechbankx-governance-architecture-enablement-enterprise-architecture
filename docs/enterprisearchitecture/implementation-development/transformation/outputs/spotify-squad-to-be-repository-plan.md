# Spotify Squad Plan and To-Be Repository Design

## Purpose

Define a **planning-only** transformation model for splitting the current monorepo into separate repositories aligned to:

1. Spotify model (tribes, squads, chapters, guilds)
2. DDD bounded contexts
3. Event-driven integration
4. High cohesion / low coupling execution

The canonical repository policy and ownership rules are defined in:
`docs/enterprisearchitecture/implementation-development/transformation/workspace-ddd-eda-2026-03-13/REPO_NAMING_AND_OWNERSHIP_STRATEGY.md`.

## Planning Constraint

- This artifact **does not modify runtime code**.
- Existing repository remains source-of-truth until extraction waves are approved.

## Guiding Architecture Rules

1. One bounded context has one primary owning squad.
2. Each service owns its data store and schema.
3. No cross-service direct DB access.
4. API-first and event-contract-first before implementation.
5. Shared code is limited to primitives and contract tooling, not domain logic.
6. Each repository has exactly one owning squad, one owning tribe, and one review cadence.

## To-Be Spotify Topology

## To-Be Repository Naming Standard

- Prefix by business platform and capability.
- Use lowercase kebab-case.
- Avoid use-case numeric naming.
- Keep one deployable service per repo for runtime services.
- Follow the canonical repo prefixes described in the repository naming strategy document.

Pattern:

- Runtime service repos: `<capability>-service`
- Platform repos: `platform-<capability>`
- Contract repos: `contracts-<capability>`
- Governance repos: `governance-<capability>`

## DDD and Event-Driven Interaction Contract

## Bounded Context Ownership

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Consent | Consent and Authorization Squad | Consent, AuthorizationGrant | `consent.created`, `consent.authorized`, `consent.revoked` | Customer lifecycle events |

| Payment | Payment Orchestration Squad | PaymentInstruction, PaymentExecution | `payment.initiated`, `payment.settled`, `payment.failed` | Risk/Compliance decision events |
| Risk | Risk and Compliance Decisioning Squad | RiskAssessment, RiskDecision | `risk.assessed` | Payment and loan request events |
| Compliance | Risk and Compliance Decisioning Squad | ComplianceDecision, AuditEvidence | `compliance.checked`, `audit.recorded` | Payment and loan request events |
| Customer | Customer and KYC Squad | CustomerProfile, KycState | `customer.created`, `customer.kyc.verified` | Identity events |

## Approved Integration Pattern

1. Command/query API calls for immediate decision points.
2. Event propagation for state synchronization and reporting.
3. Outbox pattern for all event-producing services.
4. Schema compatibility validation for all event evolution.

## Wave-Based Parallel Extraction Plan

## Wave 0: Platform Baseline

Owners: Platform and Reliability Tribe

Deliverables:

1. Identity baseline (Keycloak/LDAP/DPoP policies)
2. Mesh security baseline (STRICT mTLS + authz policy pack)
3. Event platform baseline (Kafka + schema registry + AsyncAPI policy)
4. Delivery templates baseline (Jenkins/GitLab quality gates)
5. Terraform module baseline (network, compute, secrets, observability)

## Wave 1: Low-risk Open Finance Services

Owners: Open Finance Tribe

Deliverables:

1. Payee verification service repo creation and contract freeze
2. Open products catalog service repo creation
3. ATM directory service repo creation

## Wave 2: Consent and AIS Services

Owners: Open Finance Tribe

Deliverables:

1. Consent and authorization service repo creation
2. Personal financial data service repo creation
3. Business financial data service repo creation
4. Metadata service repo creation

## Wave 3: Core lending and payment

Owners: Lending and Money Movement Tribe

Deliverables:

1. Loan lifecycle repo creation
2. Payment initiation and settlement repo creation
3. Recurring, bulk, and request-to-pay repo creation

## Wave 4: Cross-cutting completion

Owners: All tribes

Deliverables:

1. Customer, risk, compliance runtime split completion
2. Contract catalog centralization
3. Governance and runbook repos fully operational

## Quality Gates Required Before Any Repo Cutover

1. Contract tests green (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI).
2. Architecture rules green (domain layer purity).
3. Coverage threshold met (>=85% minimum).
4. Security gates green (SAST/SCA/secrets/SBOM/signing).
5. Observability baseline present (trace id, metrics, structured logs).
6. Rollback playbook and migration runbook approved.

## Decision Summary

This plan keeps current repository stable while enabling independent, parallelized execution through a squad-aligned repo strategy with explicit ownership and integration contracts.
