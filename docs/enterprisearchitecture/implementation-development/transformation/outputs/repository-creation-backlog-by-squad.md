# Repository Creation Backlog by Squad (Planning-Only)

## Purpose

Provide a PR-ready backlog to create **new repositories only** (no code migration in this phase), aligned with the approved Spotify model and DDD/event-driven boundaries.

## Backlog Categories

1. Governance and standards
2. Platform foundations
3. Domain repository bootstrap
4. Contract and event governance
5. Readiness and cutover controls

## Non-Goals for This Backlog

1. No runtime code migration in current repository.
2. No production cutover in this phase.
3. No data migration execution in this phase.

## Acceptance Gate for Planning Completion

1. Repo list approved by architecture board.
2. Squad ownership approved by tribe leads.
3. Platform and contract repos accepted by governance guilds.
4. Migration runbook template and cutover scorecard approved.
