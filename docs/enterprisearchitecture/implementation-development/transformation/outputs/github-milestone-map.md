## Suggested GitHub Setup Order
1. Create the three milestones.
2. Ensure label taxonomy exists.
3. Create issues from draft files under:
   - `<repo-root>/docs/enterprisearchitecture/implementation-development/transformation/outputs/github-issue-drafts/`
4. Assign by team lead placeholders or mapped usernames.
5. Add dependency links between issues using `Depends on #<issue-number>`.
