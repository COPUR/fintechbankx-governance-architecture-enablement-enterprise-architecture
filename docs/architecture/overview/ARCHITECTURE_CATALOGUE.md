# 🏛️ Enhanced Enterprise Banking System - Architecture Catalogue

## 📖 Executive Summary

The **Enhanced Enterprise Banking System Architecture Catalogue** provides a comprehensive overview of our secure microservices platform built with zero-trust security principles. This document serves as the definitive guide for architects, developers, and stakeholders to understand the system's design, implementation patterns, and operational characteristics.

### Architecture Vision

**"A secure-by-design, cloud-native banking platform that enforces zero-trust security at every layer while maintaining compliance with financial industry standards."**

---

## Contract-Driven Baseline (Current Repository)

This catalogue now aligns with the OpenAPI contracts under `api/openapi` and the generated API inventory in `<repo-root>/docs/API_CATALOGUE.md`.

### Source-of-Truth Rules

- API routes and security requirements are defined in `api/openapi/*.yaml`.
- Runtime controllers must match OpenAPI paths and verbs exactly.
- Any route or security-chain change must update the matching OpenAPI first, then regenerate `<repo-root>/docs/API_CATALOGUE.md`.

### Security Baseline Rules

- External traffic enters through API gateway + service mesh ingress.
- Protected APIs require OAuth2/OIDC access tokens and DPoP proof validation.
- Service-to-service traffic is mTLS-only with identity-based authorization.
- Secret material is resolved at runtime from a secret provider and never committed to source.

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Security Model

![Security Architecture](../../images/Enhanced%20Enterprise%20Banking%20Security%20Architecture.svg)

#### Security Layers

1. **Perimeter Security**
   - Istio Ingress Gateway with TLS 1.3 termination
   - OAuth2 Proxy for authentication
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting

2. **Identity & Access Management**
   - Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - LDAP/Active Directory integration

3. **Service Mesh Security**
   - Envoy sidecars for every microservice
   - Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service communication
   - JWT token validation at mesh level
   - Fine-grained authorization policies

4. **Application Security**
   - OWASP Top 10 protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS attack mitigation

#### Authentication Flow
