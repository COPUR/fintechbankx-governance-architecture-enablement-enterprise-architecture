## Disclaimer: This project is a **proof of concept** and not intended for production use. It is designed to demonstrate advanced architectural patterns and security practices in modern banking systems.
This project may not build or compile out of the box due to its complexity and dependencies on specific configurations. It is recommended to use it as a reference for architectural patterns rather than a ready-to-deploy solution.


## Enterprise Banking System

The Enterprise Banking System embodies a transformative approach to financial services architecture, engineered with modular microservices that enable institutions to rapidly configure and deploy solutions tailored to their specific market requirements. Built on hexagonal architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design, this platform offers unprecedented flexibility - allowing organizations to selectively implement components ranging from traditional lending operations to cutting-edge Islamic finance modules and CBDC integration.

The system's inherent modularity enables financial institutions to maintain operational agility while ensuring enterprise-grade security and regulatory compliance. Organizations can seamlessly transition from conventional banking operations to specialized services, or deploy hybrid configurations that serve diverse customer segments simultaneously.

## Next-Generation Banking Platform with Zero-Trust Security

The **Enhanced Enterprise Banking System** represents the pinnacle of modern financial services architecture - a **secure microservices platform** built with **zero-trust security**, **OAuth 2.1 authentication**, and **Istio service mesh**. Designed for enterprise banking institutions that demand uncompromising security, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence.

This platform transcends traditional banking systems by implementing a **secure-by-design architecture** that enforces security at every layer, from network communication to application logic, ensuring comprehensive protection of financial data and operations.

## 🔒 PCI-DSS v4.0 Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Framework

The Enterprise Banking System implements **PCI-DSS v4.0 compliance** through a comprehensive multi-layer security architecture:

#### **Layer 1: Network Security (Requirement 1)**
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** with SQL injection and XSS protection
- **DDoS protection** and rate limiting
- **Network microsegmentation** with VLAN isolation
- **Firewall rules** with quarterly penetration testing

#### **Layer 2: Secure Configurations (Requirement 2)**
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** enforcement for all service-to-service communication  
- **Zero-trust networking** with service mesh (Istio)
- **Certificate-based authentication** with automatic rotation
- **Secure default configurations** across all components

#### **Layer 3: Data Protection (Requirements 3 & 4)**
- **Cardholder data tokenization** - PAN never stored in clear text
- **CVV2 never stored** - immediate purge after processing
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** at rest with AWS KMS key management
- **TLS 1.3 encryption** in transit with Perfect Forward Secrecy
- **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (SSN, account numbers)

#### **Layer 4: Access Control (Requirements 7 & 8)**
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE** authentication with FAPI 2.0 compliance
- **DPoP token binding** (RFC 9449) for proof-of-possession
- **Multi-factor authentication** with biometric support
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with principle of least privilege
- **Administrative access controls** with session management

#### **Layer 5: Monitoring & Logging (Requirements 10 & 11)**
- **SIEM system** with real-time threat detection
- **24/7 security monitoring** with automated incident response
- **File integrity monitoring** and vulnerability scanning
- **Comprehensive audit logging** with tamper-proof storage

### FAPI 2.0 Financial-Grade API Security

| Security Control | Implementation | Standard |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Token Binding** | DPoP proof validation (RFC 9449) | FAPI 2.0 |
| **Mutual TLS** | Certificate-based client authentication | FAPI 2.0 |
| **PKCE** | Proof Key for Code Exchange | OAuth 2.1 |
| **Request Signing** | JWS request object signing | FAPI 2.0 |
| **Scope Enforcement** | Fine-grained permission validation | FAPI 2.0 |

### Core Design Principles

- **Zero-Trust Security**: Never trust, always verify with mTLS everywhere
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers with overlapping controls
- **Security by Design**: Security embedded in architecture from inception
- **Continuous Compliance**: Automated compliance validation and reporting
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation of business domains and concerns  
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Pure domain logic with infrastructure abstraction
- **FAPI 2.0 Compliance**: Financial-grade API security standards
- **BIAN Alignment**: Banking Industry Architecture Network compliance
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-first design with service mesh security

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Java 23.0.2** (OpenJDK)

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://example.com/repo.git
cd enterprise-loan-management-system

# 2. Build the application
./gradlew clean bootJar

# 3. Configure runtime via environment variables
# (See .env.template for non-secret runtime flags only)

# 4. Provision real secret material at runtime (never in .env/source)
# POST /internal/v1/system/secrets
# (stores masked/hash-only records in DB)

# 5. (Optional) Start local infrastructure dependencies with Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d postgres redis keycloak

# 6. Run the application
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```
 
## Secret Handling Policy

- Do not store real secrets in local `.env` or `.env.local` files.
- Do not hardcode secrets in source code, test fixtures, or OpenAPI examples.
- Use runtime-injected secrets only:
  - `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` (preferred secret-file mount)
  - `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (orchestrator/Vault injected environment variable)
- Provision real secret values only through runtime API:
  - `POST /internal/v1/system/secrets`
- Persist secret material as masked + hashed records; never expose raw values in API responses.
- Apply data-at-rest controls for secret storage:
  - encrypted database volumes/backups,
  - least-privilege DB access,
  - audit trails for secret mutation.
- Keep secret references (no values) in:
  - `security/secrets/secret-references.yaml`

Infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD assets have been removed or redacted to keep this repository environment-agnostic.
